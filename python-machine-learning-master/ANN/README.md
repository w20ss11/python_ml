# Artificial Neural Network

* **xor.py**
  * ANN with 1 hidden layer for learning an XOR gate

* **xor_noisy_test.py**
  * ANN with 1 hidden layer for learning an XOR gate. Shows the effect of adding noise to the test set data. Noise sampled from normal distributions with varying standard deviations.

* **xor_noisy_train.py**
  * ANN with 1 hidden layer for learning an XOR gate. Shows the effect of adding noise to both the train and test set data. Noise sampled from normal distributions with varying standard deviations.
